                    <p>At the heart of this project is a real-world need identified by a business owner who was seeking
                        a tool to manage their restaurant's activity flow. Through collaborative brainstorming and idea
                        sketching, we developed a robust yet uncomplicated application that serves the needs of both
                        employees and managers alike.</p>

                    <p>Our application features a robust role-based access control system that enables various levels of
                        user permissions. </p>

                        advanced actions:</p>

                            restaurant's workflow.</li>
                        <li>Employees have basic access, which allows them to read relevant information and submit
                            predefined forms.</li>

                    <p>At the heart of this project is a real-world need identified by a business owner who was seeking
                        a tool to manage their restaurant's activity flow. Through collaborative brainstorming and idea
                        sketching, we developed a robust yet uncomplicated application that serves the needs of both
                        employees and managers alike.</p>

                    <p>Our application features a robust role-based access control system that enables various levels of

                        advanced actions:</p>

                        <li>The system administrator has the highest level of access, allowing them to manage users.</li>
                        <li>The restaurant managers have intermediate access to manage various aspects of the
                            restaurant's workflow.</li>
                        <li>Employees have basic access, which allows them to read relevant information and complete
                            predefined forms.</li>
